# overview

   * Using handlebars and express, create a route called `/dog`. When the route is hit, it will display the animaltype, pet and fierceness for the dog.

  * Create an `/all-pets` route. It will loop over all the animals and display  all the pets  to the user.
  
   * Create an `/all-non-pets` route. It will loop over all the animals and display  all the none pets  to the user.
